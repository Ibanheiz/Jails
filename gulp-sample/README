# Jails's gulp setup

### Quick start

#### 1. Installing gulp-jails

```
sudo npm install
```

#### 2. Creating Home App

```
gulp jails/app -n home
```

#### 3. Just to be sure, log something on apps/home.js

```js
this.init = function(){
    console.log(this);
};
```

#### 4. Build just apps/home application

```
gulp jails/build -p home
```

#### That's it.. Enjoy ;)
